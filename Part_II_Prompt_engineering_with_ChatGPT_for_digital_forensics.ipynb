        "Hansken is an open platform for investigative and security agencies to search and analyze digital traces from seized digital devices such as phones and computers. Hansken has been around for more than 10 years. It was developed by the Netherlands Forensic Institute and is based on Hadoop and Elasticsearch, among others, making it capable of processing and storing petabytes of digital data.\n",

        "Hansken processes digital traces using a trace model. Using the Hansken Query Language (HQL), these traces can be searched in the elasticsearch database at lightning speed.

        "Based on Quan's internet activity, it appears that he was involved in some potentially suspicious activities around the time he and Joseph were arrested with a large sum of cash. Here's a summary of his internet history and some possible insights into his motive and activities related to the money:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Quan searched for \"whatsapp group gambling\" multiple times on July 4th, indicating an interest in or involvement with gambling. This suggests a potential connection to the large sum of cash they were carrying.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. He also searched for \"whatsapp group fitness,\" which might suggest an attempt to divert attention from his gambling-related activities by engaging in fitness-related discussions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. On July 5th, he searched for \"risks drug smuggling\" and \"drug trafficking punishment UK.\" These searches raise suspicion about possible involvement in illicit activities, possibly drug-related. It's possible that Quan was exploring the risks and consequences of such activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Quan searched for \"London City Airport\" on July 9th and looked up flights from London to Amsterdam. This could indicate an interest in or plans for international travel, which might be related to money laundering or smuggling activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. He also searched for \"saowapa utrecht menu\" and \"friends finder utrecht\" on July 9th, suggesting that he might have been planning meetings or gatherings in Utrecht. These activities could be related to his money-related plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Quan showed interest in \"computing science UU\" and \"gambling addiction\" on July 9th, which could indicate a desire to understand the technology and psychology behind gambling, potentially for his own benefit.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. On July 20th, he searched for \"transport for London,\" which could be related to his travel plans or potentially scouting transportation routes for illicit activities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, Quan's internet activity suggests a possible connection between his interest in gambling, potential drug-related concerns, international travel plans, and inquiries into the consequences of illicit activities. It's possible that he and Joseph were involved in illegal activities such as money laundering, drug smuggling, or gambling, and the large sum of cash they were carrying might be linked to these activities. Further investigation and evidence would be necessary to confirm any wrongdoing."

        "Analyzing the provided information, including the date times, locations, chats, and browser history, here are some potential connections and insights about suspect Quan:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Date and Location Correlations:**\n",
        "   - On July 9, 2022, Quan was in a location with coordinates in the vicinity of Amsterdam (+52.25898, +004.55368).\n",
        "   - On July 15, 2022, Quan was in another location near Amsterdam (+52.30876, +004.76278).\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Chats and Location Correlations:**\n",
        "   - Quan's chat with Joseph on July 12, 2022, indicates that he was arranging to pick up Joseph at an airport, which might explain the July 15 location (potentially an airport).\n",
        "   - Quan's chat with Sheila on July 8, 2022, mentions that he is in Germany to meet a family member. This corresponds to the date and location on July 9, 2022, which is near the German border.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Browser History and Location Correlations:**\n",
        "   - Quan's browser history on July 5, 2022, includes searches related to drug smuggling risks and drug trafficking punishment in the UK, which could be relevant to the location data.\n",
        "   - The searches related to London City Airport and flights between London and Amsterdam on July 9, 2022, might suggest that Quan was planning travel between these cities.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Chats and Browser History Correlations:**\n",
        "   - Quan's chat with Figo on July 5, 2022, contains discussions about a \"party\" and instructions for a \"family visit.\" The chat content does not explicitly mention illegal activities, but it does raise questions about the nature of these events.\n",
        "   - The browser history on July 5, 2022, includes searches related to drug smuggling and drug trafficking punishment, which might be relevant to the chat about a \"family visit.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Overall Suspicions:**\n",
        "   - Quan's chats and online activity, such as searching for information on drug smuggling and trafficking, raise suspicions of potential involvement in illegal activities.\n",
        "   - The chat with Joseph regarding instructions for a \"family visit\" involving the exchange of a suitcase and photos of drugs and a lab is concerning and might indicate involvement in illicit trade.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Travel and International Connections:**\n",
        "   - Quan's movements between the Netherlands, Germany, and potential international flights (e.g., London) suggest a level of mobility and potential connections to activities that may span multiple locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that while these correlations raise suspicions, they do not provide conclusive evidence of criminal activity. Further investigation, including a thorough examination of the content of the photos, additional chats, and any other relevant evidence, would be necessary to determine Quan's involvement in any illegal activities and the nature of his connections."
