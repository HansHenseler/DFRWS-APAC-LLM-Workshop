        "Hansken is an open platform for investigative and security agencies to search and analyze digital traces from seized digital devices such as phones and computers. Hansken has been around for more than 10 years. It was developed by the Netherlands Forensic Institute and is based on Hadoop and Elasticsearch, among others, making it capable of processing and storing petabytes of digital data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Hansken processes digital traces using a trace model. Using the Hansken Query Language (HQL), these traces can be searched in the elasticsearch database at lightning speed. HQL is a powerful language similar to other query languages such as SQL but completely focused on the Hansken trace model.Here’s a quick rundown with examples of the main features of HQL-human, the Hansken Query Language for humans.\n",
